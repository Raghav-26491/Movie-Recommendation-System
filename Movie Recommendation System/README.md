Movie Recommendation System

This Movie Recommendation System uses content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their similarity in tags (combining overview and genre).

Overview
This project utilizes a dataset of movies (Movies_dataset.csv) containing information about movie titles, overviews, and genres. Initially, the dataset is processed to extract relevant information and create a recommendation system based on movie similarities.

Features

•	Data Pre-processing: The dataset is cleaned and transformed to create a tags column by combining overview and genre.

•	Recommendation Algorithm: Uses cosine similarity to suggest movies similar to the selected one.

•	Streamlit App: Utilizes Streamlit for creating an interactive user interface to select movies and view recommendations.

How to Use

•	Setup: Clone this repository to your local environment.

•	Dependencies: Install necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

•	Run the App: Execute streamlit run app.py to launch the app.

•	Select a Movie: Choose a movie from the dropdown menu.

•	Get Recommendations: Click the "Show Recommendations" button to view recommended movies.
