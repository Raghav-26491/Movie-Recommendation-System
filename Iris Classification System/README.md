Iris Classification System
This repository contains Python code for an Iris Classification System. The system performs classification tasks using the Iris dataset. 
The code involves data analysis, visualization, model training, and a Flask app for predictions.

Files:
•	Main.py
•	This file contains the main code for data analysis, visualization, model training, and saving the trained model using various machine learning algorithms.

•	deploy.py
•	This file contains the Flask app for deployment, where the saved model is loaded to predict the Iris species based on user inputs through a web interface.

•	index.html
•	This HTML file provides a simple form for user input. It contains input fields for Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. 
  Upon form submission, the predicted class will be displayed.

•	saved_model.sav
•	This file contains the trained model serialized using the pickle module. It is loaded by the Flask app for making predictions.

Instructions:
•	Running the Code: Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (such as pandas, sklearn, Flask, seaborn, etc.).
•	Data: The code assumes the presence of the Iris dataset in a file named "Iris.csv." Adjust the file name or path if needed.
•	Main.py: Run this file to execute the data analysis, model training, and save the trained model as "saved_model.sav".
•	deploy.py: Run this file to deploy the trained model as a Flask web app. Access the predictions via the web interface by opening the index.html file in a browser.

Usage:
•	Main.py: Execute this file to perform data analysis, visualize the dataset, train machine learning models, and save the trained model.
•	deploy.py: Run this file to deploy the trained model as a Flask web app. Use the provided web interface (index.html) to enter input data and get predictions.

Requirements:
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.
